# FoodTracker
Web service aimed at reducing food wastage.It checks for items in nearby supermarkets(if they are registered with the service) that have a large discount and/or close to expiring, and suggests recpies alongwith images and description using these. Used Vue.js for frontend, and Node.js for server machine(backend). Axios library helped in handling requests. Also created typical supermarket databases in MongoDB for the prototype demonstration. Spoonacular was used as the Recipe recommendation API.
